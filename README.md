# Tools Details 

### Arp Cache Poisiner Tools:

This tool is used to implement the Arp Cache Poisoning attack on the target

### Fake Access Point Creator Tools:

This tool is used to create fake access points

### SSID Hidden Locator Tools:

This tool is responsible for finding Wireless and Access Point devices that are hidden

### Hash Creator Tools:

This tool is used to convert Plain-Text texts to Cipher-Text texts using Hash algorithms.

### SYN Flooder Tools:

This tool is used to implement the Syn Flooding attack, which is a Denial-Of-Service attack

### Network Packet Capture Tools:

This tool is used to record ongoing traffic from the interface

### AP And WIFI Device Detection Tools:

This tool is used to detect the Mac and SSID addresses of AP and Wireless devices

### Public IP Changer In 3 Per Second:

This tool changes the general IP address of your system once every 3 seconds using the Tor service.
Note: This tool is missing on Linux systems along with System-D

### Wi-Fi Deauthentication Attacker Tools:

This tool is used to implement the Deauthentication attack on Wirelss networks

### Tcp Port Scanner Tools:

This tool is used to scan Tcp protocol ports. This tool, unlike similar tools in other frameworks, has a higher scanning power

## Live IP And Device scanner Tools:

This tool is used to scan IP addresses and Mac addresses of active devices within the network

## Mac Flooder Tools

This tool is used for Mac Flooding attacks on Layer 2 networks. Attacks such as CAM / MAC Table OverFlow can be implemented with this tool

## Arp Spoofing And Arp Cache Poinsing Attack Detection Tools

This tool is used to detect Arp Cache Poisoning attacks
If your system is attacked by Arp Cache Poisoning, it will notify you if this tool is running

## Vlan Hopping Attacker Tools(Double Tagging Method)

#This tool is used for Layer 2 network attacks for unauthorized access to other vlan
#This tool is used to implement Vlan hopping attack through Double Tagging Method
